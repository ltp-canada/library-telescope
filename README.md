# library-telescope
Tools for getting easy-to-use telescopes into Canadian public libraries.

See [librarytelescope.org](https://www.librarytelescope.org/) for more information on library telescopes in general.

For the moment, the activity in this project will be in the wiki, and on the issues page.
